This document describes the v1 Tidepool data formats.  Well, a sub-set of them right now, anyway.  But it will have all of them soon.

All events in the tidepool platform are JSON formatted.  They all share a "type" field that defines the type of the event.  The semantics of the other fields in the events are generally defined individually per type, but there are some common fields defined below.  

The defined fields for an event type are a minimal set of fields that should be set, all event types can have any number of extra fields on them.  This is to allow for a bit of flexibility in changes to the data model.  There is also a `grabbag` type that exists purely for free-form definition of data types.  Note that Tidepool is reserving the right to introduce and define the semantics for any field on a non-`grabbag` event.  So, if you do choose to attach an extra field onto an event for individualized purposes, it will be in your own best interest to give it a name that is not likely to collide with a field we might choose to define in the future.

## Common Fields

### time

An ISO8601 timestamp with a timezone.

### deviceId

An indication of the device that generated the datum.  This should be globally unique.  A device make and model with serial number is a good value to include here.

### source

The original source of the data.  This is something like `diasend` if the data came from Diasend, `carelink` if from Carelink, `device` if it came directly from a device, etc.

This is primarily used for annotative and informational purposes.

## Extra Fields

### timezoneOffset

The `timezoneOffset` field can be attached to any of the events detailed here.  It specifies the timezone offset in minutes that was used to convert the timestamp for that specific datum from the device.  The timezone offset is the number of minutes that should be added (can be a negative number) to a UTC timestamp to generate "local" time.

A significant number of diabetes devices (read: all that Tidepool is currently aware of) do not maintain an accurate UTC timestamp, instead they only provide the local time.  This means that when you change the time on the device due to changes in timezone, you are actually changing the time that your data is getting associated with.  This provides the user with a basic indication of what time it is when things are happening, but it actually makes it very difficult to accurately correlate data sets from disparate sources.

When dealing with these data sets, the time provided *must* be turned into an ISO8601 timestamp string with a timezone before being sent into the tidepool platform.  This conversion can be faulty (it is most simply done by asking the user what timezone their data is in and applying that across the board), so when this is done, the name of the timezone (as found in the IANA Time Zone Database, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) that was used should be attached to the event on the `timezone` field.

This provides two benefits

1. Visualizations on top of the data have the ability to reverse the transformation that was initially performed, if they so choose.
2. If a user knows that they took a trip to, e.g., New York for a week and their timezone needs to be updated, a tool can be created to re-adjust the timezone by first reversing the transformation and then adjusting the time according to the new timezone.

### units

Read about units below.

### creationTime

There is a `creationTime` field that is auto-generated on all events.  This is the machine time that the event was first created.

### modifiedTime

There is a `modifiedTime` field that is auto-generated on all events that have been modified.  This is the machine time of the most recent modification of the event.

## Units

The Tidepool platform processes blood glucose data in `mg/dL` format.  We chose `mg/dL` instead of `mmol/L` because `mg/dL` is an integer and dealing with integers generally avoids weird behaviors that can arise from working with floating point numbers.  While the likelihood of `mmol/L` actually causing any of those is admittedly low, neither unit is necessarily "better" than the other and this "reason" provided a tie breaker for the decision.

Most event types that include a blood glucose reading can also have a units field specified.  When that field is `mmol/L`, we will convert the value to `mg/dL` and store the result.  The units field will be preserved, but the numerical values will all be in `mg/dL`.  The algorithm followed for conversion is

1. If units field exists and is `mmol/L`
2. Check the value, if below 39 convert
3. Multiply the value by 18.0182
4. Floor away any values after the decimal point

If you have a case where you are worried about legitimately generated BG values above 40 in `mmol/L` or otherwise disagree with the conversion algorithm, the HTTP API allows you to attach a query parameter `noUnitConversion` to your event submission.  When this is set, the conversion algorithm will be skipped with the expectation that you have already done the conversion.
